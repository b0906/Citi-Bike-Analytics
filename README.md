# Citi-Bike-Analytics

## Background
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the company has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so this project is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Steps
* Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
* Design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). Work with a timespan of my choosing. Optionally, I also merge multiple datasets from different periods.
##
* The following are questions are suggestions for a starting point.
1. How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
2. By what percentage has total ridership grown?
3. How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
4. What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?
5. What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the winter months?
6. Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why do I hypothesize these are the top locations?
7. Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?
8. Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why?
9. Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?
10. How does the average trip duration change by age?
11. What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?
12. Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?
13. How variable is the utilization by bike ID?
##
* Use my visualizations to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards are accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring.


## Create one of the following visualizations for city officials:
### Basic: A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top.
##

### Advanced: A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.


note: The map is accompanied by a write-up describing any trends that were noticed during my analysis.

##
## Create my final presentation.
### Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
